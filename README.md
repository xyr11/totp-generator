# xyr11/totp-generator

*A time-based one-time password (TOTP) generator implementation in Javascript*

The contents of the webpage is from [russau](https://jsfiddle.net/user/russau/fiddles/)'s [TOTP One-time password](https://jsfiddle.net/russau/ch8PK/) from JSFiddle which I edited and improved to fully work offline. For the QR generator, I replaced [the original](https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes "the original was Google Charts API") with [QRious (neocotic/qrious)](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious). Since as of right now I haven't learned jQuery, I haven't been able to convert the part of the code that relies on jQuery to pure Javascript.

The original code doesn't have a license, and QRious is released under the [GPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
